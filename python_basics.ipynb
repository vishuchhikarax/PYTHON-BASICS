        "1.  What is Python, and why is it popular?\n",
        " - Python is a programming language that's easy to read and write. People like it because it's simple to\n",
        " learn, works for many things ( like websites, games, data, and AI ), and has tons of tools already built in.\n",
        "2.   What is an interpreter in Python?\n",
        "  - An interpreter is like a translator that reads your Python code one line at a time and runs it right away.\n",
        "3.   What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n",
        "  - Keywords are special words in Python like if, else, while, and for. These words already have a job,\n",
        "  so you can't use them for other things like naming a variable.\n",
        "4.   Can keywords be used as variable names?\n",
        "  - Nope! You can't use keywords as variable names because Python needs them to understand your code.\n",
        "5.   What is mutability in Python?\n",
        "- Mutability means whether something can be changed or not.\n",
        "- If it can change (like a list), it's mutable.\n",
        "- If it can't change (like a tuple), it's immutable.\n",
        "6.   Why are lists mutable, but tuples are not?\n",
        "- Lists are made to be flexible, so you can add or remove stuff. Tuples are meant to stay the same\n",
        "after you make them - kind of like a locked box.\n",
        "7.   What's the difference between == and is in Python?\n",
        "- == checks if two things look the same (same value).\n",
        "- is checks if they are actually the same object in memory.\n",
        "8.   What are logical operators in Python?\n",
        "Logical operators help you combine conditions:\n",
        "- and: Both things must be true\n",
        "- or: At least one must be true\n",
        "- not: Flips true to false, and false to true\n",
        "9.   What is type casting in Python?\n",
        "- Type casting is when you change a value from one type to another, like turning a number into a\n",
        "string, or a string into a number.\n",
        "10.   What's the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n",
        "- Implicit casting: Python changes the type for you automatically.\n",
        "- Explicit casting: You tell Python to change it using something like int() or str().\n",
        "11.   What's the point of conditional statements in Python?\n",
        "- They let your code make decisions, like \"if this happens, do that.\"\n",
        "12.   How does elif work?\n",
        "- elif means \"else if.\" It lets you check more than one condition. If the first if isn't true, Python checks\n",
        "the elif, and so on.\n",
        "13.   What's the difference between for and while loops?\n",
        "- Use a for loop when you know how many times to repeat something.\n",
        "- Use a while loop when you don't know how many times - it keeps going while a condition is true.\n",
        "14.   When is a while loop better than a for loop?\n",
        "- If you're asking a user to type something (like a password), and you don't know how many tries\n",
        "they'll take, a while loop is better."
